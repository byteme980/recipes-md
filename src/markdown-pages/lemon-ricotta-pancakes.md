## Ingredients

- 5 eggs
- 1 lemon
- 0.5 tsp baking soda
- 0.5 c ricotta cheese
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 0.125 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1.125 c flour
- 2 tbsp butter, melted
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 0.25 c cheddar cheese, shredded
- 1 c cherry tomatoes, diced
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 1 oz baby spinach
- 1 c blueberries, or any type of fresh berry/fruit
- 2 avocado

## Steps

### Step 1: Make the batter

Add the following wet ingredients to a large bowl and mix with a whisk until smooth:

- 3/4 cold water
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 cup ricotta cheese
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 large egg

Add the following dry ingredients and butter to the mix and stir until flour just about disappears. You do not want to over-mix:

- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon fine salt

Let the batter sit on the countertop for 15 minutes to rise.

### Step 2 - Make the eggs

Dice 1 cup of cherry tomatoes and saut√© with one handful of spinach in a non-stick pan for about 2 minutes in olive oil.

Mix 4 eggs in a small bowl and pour over the veggies. Cook, mixing occasionally for about 2-4 minutes until eggs are mostly hardened.

Take the pan off of the heat, sprinkle cheese over the eggs, cover pan, and set it to the side while you finish with the pancakes.

### Step 3 - Cook the pancakes

Coat a large pan/skillet with vegetable oil and heat over medium high heat. Cook pancakes 2-3 minutes per side in batches.

### Step 4 - Plate and enjoy

Scoop out the avocado meat and sprinkle with large grain salt. Plate avocado, berries, eggs and pancakes and enjoy.
