## Ingredients

- salt to taste
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 c flour, for dredging
- 6 tbsp butter
- 4 chicken breast, halved horizontally
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 1 shallot, peeled and sliced thin
- 1 lemon, half sliced into thin circles and seeded, half juiced
- 0.75 c chicken stock
- 3 tbsp capers, drained
- 1 c rice
- parsley to taste, for garnish (optional)
- 4 oz baby spinach, or any other salad ingredient or green veggie

## Steps

1. Start cooking the rice. Get all the ingredients out and prepped.
2. Hammer chicken breast halves to even thickness. Season both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper. Dredge the chicken in flour and shake off any excess.
3. In a large skillet working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, add the chicken and sauté over medium-high heat until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Use 1 tablespoons butter and some olive oil for each batch. Having some drinks while the chicken is frying is a very good idea.
4. After the chicken is cooked, add the shallot and lemon slices to the pan and sauté, stirring occasionally, until lightly caramelized and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the stock and simmer until reduced by half, about 3 minutes.
5. Reduce the heat to low, then stir in the remaining 3 tablespoons butter, capers and lemon juice, to taste. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the chicken with the sauce poured over the top. Serve with rice and greens.
