## Ingredients

- 1 pound brussels sprouts
- 1 lemon
- extra-virgin olive oil
- salt and freshly ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon red-pepper flakes
- 1 18-ounce package shelf-stable gnocchi
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced into 6 pieces
- ½ teaspoon honey
- Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving

## Steps

Trim and halve the brussels sprouts. Zest lemon.

In a 12-inch skillet, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high. Arrange the sprouts in an even layer. Add, salt, pepper, and lemon zest over the top and cook, undisturbed, until the brussels sprouts are well browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes.

Add the red-pepper flakes, stir and cook until the brussels sprouts are crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl.

In the same skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high. Break up any gnocchi that are stuck together, add them to the pan and cook, covered and undisturbed, until golden brown on one side, 2 to 4 minutes.

Add the butter and honey, season with salt and a generous amount of black pepper, and cook, stirring, until the butter is golden, nutty smelling and foaming, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the brussels sprouts until warmed through. Serve with grated Parmesan.
