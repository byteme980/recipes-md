## About the recipe

Serves 6

Total time: 30 mins

Source: NYTimes Cooking

## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 1 small globe eggplant, cut into 1-inch pieces (about 5 cups)
- 1 medium onion, coarsely chopped
- 3 medium plum tomatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- Salt and black pepper
- 1 pound short pasta, such as rotini
- 2 medium zucchini, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 medium orange bell pepper, cored and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 2 basil sprigs (optional)
- Freshly grated Parmesan (optional)


## Steps

Pour 1/4 cup oil into a large, wide pot or Dutch oven over low heat. Add the tomato paste and gently fry, stirring occasionally, until slightly caramelized, 3 to 5 minutes. (The oil will become a bright shade of orange.) Add the Italian seasoning and stir until combined.

To the pot, add the eggplant, onion, zucchini, peppers, half the tomatoes, all the garlic and 1 teaspoon salt. Toss until vegetables are coated with the tomato-infused oil. The eggplant will absorb most if not all the oil. Add 3 cups water, the pasta and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, cover and cook the pasta for half the time listed for al dente on the package directions, 4 to 6 minutes.

Remove the lid and stir well to combine pasta with the sauce. Add the remaining tomatoes and a few grinds of black pepper. Fold to combine, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook until pasta is al dente and peppers are crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove lid, and turn off heat. Taste and season with salt and pepper as desired. Serve in shallow bowls and top with torn basil leaves. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with Parmesan, if using.
