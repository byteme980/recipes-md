## About the recipe

Serves 2

Total time: 95 mins (25 mins active, 70 mins inactive)

Source: we made this up

## Ingredients

- 2 sirloin steaks
- 1 lb asparagus
- 1 pinch rosemary
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 garlic clove, minced
- 1 lb red potato
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 lemon, for the juice
- 0.5 tbsp butter

## Steps

1. (-10 mins in) Fill a large soup pot with hot water. Put the sous vide in there and get that stuff heating up.
2. (-5 mins in) Trim the steaks to get rid of all the tough parts. Put the two steaks in separate zip lock bags with 1 tbsp olive oil and once minced garlic clove each. Put a butter knife at the bottom of the bag so it will sink in the water. Dunk the bags in the water to push out all the air and seal them. Clothes pin them to the side of the pot. Get the timer going, it will probably be about 90 minutes from now. When you pop them in, we are at 0 minutes in.
3. (70 mins in) Dice the potatoes into 3/4 inch chunks. Drizzle with olive oil, pinch of salt, and pinch of rosemary. Mix to coat evenly. Put that stuff on a foil lined sheet tray and pop it in the oven at 400ÂºF for 20 mins.
4. (80 mins in) Trim the butts off of the asparagus. Put them on a plate and cover with a doubled over damp paper towel. Pop those babies in the microwave for 2 1/2 minutes to microsteam them.
5. (85 mins in) Get the cast iron starting to heat up. When it is hot, put a the butter in the pan and sear the steaks for about 60 seconds on each side and also do the edges for a bit.
6. (90 mins in) When the potatoes say they are done, broil them for 4 minutes more.
7. (95 mins in) Plate everything and squeeze some lemon over the asparagus.
