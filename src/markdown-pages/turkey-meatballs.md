## Ingredients

- 2 pounds ground turkey 93% lean
- 1 cup bread crumbs
- 2/3 cup onion, minced
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley, minced
- 2 large eggs
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon dried basil

- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Steps

Preheat oven to 400ºF.

(Optional) Lightly fry onion and garlic until soft.

In a large bowl, combine ground turkey, bread crumbs, onion, parsley, eggs, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, basil, oregano, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper, Parmesan cheese. Mix well.

Shape the mixture into 1-inch balls (you should have around 48 total).

Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil for easy cleanup. Coat a wire rack with nonstick spray and set on prepared baking sheet.

Arrange meatballs on rack, brush with oil, and bake until browned with crispy edges, about 20 minutes (an internal thermometer should read 165 degrees for 15 seconds).
