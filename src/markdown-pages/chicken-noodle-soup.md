## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground chicken
- 5 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
- 1.5 tsp ground coriander
- 0.5 tsp celery seeds (optional)
- 1 large carrot, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 2 celery stalks, halved lengthwise, then sliced 1/2-inch thick
- 1 large shallot, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves (or 1 tsp dried thyme leaves)
- 7 to 8 cups chicken stock, plus more as needed
- 8 oz orzo, cavatelli, or other small pasta

## Steps

1. In a large pot, heat 3 tablespoons oil over medium-high. Add the chicken, season generously with salt and pepper, and cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until starting to crumble, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic, coriander and celery seeds (if using), and cook, stirring frequently, until chicken is cooked through, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, scoop the chicken into a small lidded bowl (to retain moisture); cover and set aside.

2. Add the carrot, celery, shallot, thyme and the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the pot, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until slicked with fat, 3 minutes. Add the stock (7 cups for a stew-like soup or up to 8 cups for a brothy soup) and bring to a boil over high.

3. Add noodles and cook over medium-high until al dente according to package directions. (If the noodles absorb a lot of liquid, add more broth according to taste.) Add the reserved chicken and any accumulated juices and heat until warmed, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide among bowls. Enjoy!
