## About the recipe

Total time: 45 mins (25 mins active, 20 mins inactive)

Source: [15 Spatulas](https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/quick-chicken-noodle-soup/)

## Ingredients

- 8 c chicken stock
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1.5 c carrot, cut into circles and half circles
- 1.5 c celery, chopped
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 1 pinch thyme
- 1 lb chicken thigh, finely chopped
- 1 pinch salt
- 8 oz orzo pasta
- 1 pinch freshly ground black pepper

## Steps

1. Start a pot to boil for the pasta. Cook separately and add the pasta to your individual bowls of soup as you eat them. This way it doesn't get soggy.
2. Heat a soup pot over medium heat, then add the olive oil, celery, carrots, onion, salt, and black pepper. Cook for 10 minutes until softened.
3. Add the chicken broth and thyme, bring the soup to a boil (~5 minutes on high), then reduce to a simmer over low heat.
4. Simmer for 10 minutes, then add the chopped chicken and simmer for 3 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.
5. Taste the broth and make any necessary seasoning adjustments. Depending on the salt content of the broth you use, it may need additional salt.
6. Serve the soup in bowls with a handful of noodles added to each one. Enjoy!
