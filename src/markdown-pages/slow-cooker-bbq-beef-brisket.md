## Ingredients

- 3-4 lb brisket
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 tbsp kosher salt
- 1 1/2 tbsp smoked paprika
- 1 tbsp onion powder
- 1 tbsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tbsp Ancho chili powder
- 1 tsp cracked black pepper
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1/2 tsp oregano

## Steps

Trim the fat side of the brisket until 1/4 inch of fat remains

Mix all of the spices then gently pat onto all sides of the meat.

Place the brisket into the slow cooker, fat side up, and cook for 10-12 hours on low.

Save drippings from slow cooker. Boil these down to make a nice sauce.

Place the brisket on a baking sheet and broil in the oven on the center rack for 3-5 minutes or until the meat is as charred as desired.

Remove the brisket from the oven and wrap it in foil.

Rest for 45 minutes to an hour before slicing against the grain to serve.

Enjoy!
