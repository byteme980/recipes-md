## Ingredients

- 2 pounds chicken thighs
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 10 ounces brussels sprouts
- 1 red onion, sliced into 8 wedges
- 6 cloves garlic

## Steps

To marinate the chicken, put the chicken thighs to a large bowl. Then add olive oil, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, lemon juice, and dijon mustard and mix to coat. Let sit while preparing the other ingredients.

Place trimmed and halved brussels sprouts on a sheet pan, followed by red onion, and garlic cloves.

Drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Toss so that everything is well coated.

Place marinated chicken thighs skin side up on the sheet pan. Bake uncovered at 400ÂºF. If bone-in for 30 minutes, otherwise, 25 minutes. Then crisp the skin up and brown it under the broiler for a few minutes.
