## Steps

_Note: If you donâ€™t have a huge wok, then use two pans for cooking. After adding rice/all ingredients and mixing, split and transfer to finish cooking_

### Cook the rice

_do this ahead of time_

- Cook 1 cup of dried jasmine rice with two cups of water in a rice cooker.
- When it is done, take it out onto a plate and let it cool

### Fry the rice

- Get a wok ripping hot
- In a small bowl, mix chopped chicken with 1 tbsp soy sauce and two tsp sugar. Stir to coat
- Add garlic, onion, and chili flakes to wok, cook for about 10 seconds
- Add chicken to wok, mix constantly until cooked through, about 1.5 minutes
- Push contents to one side, crack three eggs on other side and scramble. Cook until ~75% done, still a lil runny
- Add rice, fish sauce, oyster sauce, green onion, tomatoes, and basil leaves. Cook, constantly mixing for a few minutes. (split to two pans for this step if your wok is not large enough)

### Serve the rice

- Plate the dish with sliced tomato and cucumber along with a lime wedge and some cilantro
