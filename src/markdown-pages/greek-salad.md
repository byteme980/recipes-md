## Ingredients

- 12 oz tomato, cherry, or any kind chopped into bite sized chunks
- 0.25 c red wine vinegar
- 0.25 red onion, thinly french cut
- 0.25 c olives
- 12 oz cucumber
- 0.25 c olive oil
- 4 oz feta cheese, crumbled
- 1 to taste salt
- 2 pinch oregano
- 1 head of romaine lettuce

## Steps

1. In a small bowl, combine onion with vinegar and let soak while you prepare the other ingredients, about 15 minutes. Drain onions, reserving vinegar

2. In a salad bowl or large mixing bowl, combine romaine, tomatoes, cucumber, olives, onion, olive oil, and about 2 tablespoons (30ml) of the vinegar left over from quick-pickling onion. Season with salt and one large pinch of oregano, toss gently to combine, then adjust to taste with more salt and vinegar, if desired

3. Lay slabs of feta on top, sprinkle with remaining pinch of oregano, and drizzle with olive oil. Serve, soaking up juices with bread
