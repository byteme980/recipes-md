## Ingredients

- 8 tortilla

- 0.5 c cheddar cheese
- 1 c guacamole
- 0.25 c sour cream

## Steps

- Arrange the chicken in a single layer in your Instant Pot
- Sprinkle the seasoning on both sides of the chicken, making sure to rearrange the pieces in a single layer on the bottom
- Pour 1 cups of salsa evenly over the chicken pieces and mix everything together
- Press the “Manual” or “Pressure Cook” button and set time for 10 minutes
- 12 mins and vent should close. 2 mins and timer should start. 10 mins and timer should end. 24 mins total inactive
- When the chicken is finished cooking, immediately release the pressure manually. 2 minutes to de-steam
- Remove the lid right away and transfer the chicken to a bowl to prevent overcooking
- Use two forks to shred the chicken (9 minutes)

- To be fancy, make a quesadilla. Add cheese and chicken to tortilla, fold in half. Heat on pan with some canola oil for 2 minutes on each side.
