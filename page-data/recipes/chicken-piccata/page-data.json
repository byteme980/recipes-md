Get all the ingredients out and prepped.</li>\n<li>Hammer chicken breast halves to even thickness. Season both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper. Dredge the chicken in flour and shake off any excess.</li>\n<li>In a large skillet working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, add the chicken and sauté over medium-high heat until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Use 1 tablespoons butter and some olive oil for each batch. Having some drinks while the chicken is frying is a very good idea.</li>\n<li>After the chicken is cooked, add the shallot and lemon slices to the pan and sauté, stirring occasionally, until lightly caramelized and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the stock and simmer until reduced by half, about 3 minutes.</li>\n<li>Reduce the heat to low, then stir in the remaining 3 tablespoons butter, capers and lemon juice, to taste. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the chicken with the sauce poured over the top. Serve with rice and greens.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 14, 2021","slug":"/recipes/chicken-piccata","title":"Chicken piccata with rice and greens","imageUrl":"https://recipes-md.s3.amazonaws.com/images/chicken-piccata.jpeg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/recipes/chicken-piccata"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
