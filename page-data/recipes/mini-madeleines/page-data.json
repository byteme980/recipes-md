Add the eggs one by one.</p>\n<p>Whisk in the butter mixture. Whisk in the lemon and orange zests.</p>\n<p>Put batter in piping bag, seal and store in refrigerator for at least 12 hours.</p>\n<h3>Day 2: Pipe, Bake, and Serve</h3>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 350°F and use convection.</p>\n<p>Cut an opening about ½ inch straight across the tip of the bag.</p>\n<p>Using a bit of cold butter, coat the cavities of the mini madeleine pan. Pipe the madeleine batter into the cavities so that it fills each about three-quarters of the way to the top.</p>\n<p>Place a rimmed sheet (shit) pan upside down on the oven rack then place the mold on top and bake the madeleines for about 2 to 2½ minutes on the center rack. When you see the batter puff up in the center, rotate the mold 180 degrees. Bake for 2 to 2½ minutes more, until the sides of the madeleines are golden blonde and the center has set.</p>\n<p>Unmold immediately. Using a small sieve, sprinkle confectioners’ sugar evenly over the fresh-baked madeleines. Eat immediately (do not wait for more than even a few minutes!).</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>Madeleines are good only when freshly baked. Do not attempt to store them. However, you can keep the batter in a closed airtight container, with plastic wrap pressed onto the surface, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 09, 2021","slug":"/recipes/mini-madeleines","title":"Mini Madeleines","imageUrl":"https://recipes-md.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mini-madeleines.png"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/recipes/mini-madeleines"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
