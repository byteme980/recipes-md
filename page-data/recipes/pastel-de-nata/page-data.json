Roll out the dough until it is about a ¼ inch thick. With the short edge facing you, roll up the dough as you would roll a thick cigar. Once you have your log-shaped dough, wrap it in plastic and chill it in the fridge while you make and cool the custard.</li>\n<li>In a large saucepan combine the egg yolks, heavy cream, milk, sugar, flour, cinnamon, vanilla and salt and whisk until there are no lumps. Add the orange and lemon peels. Place the saucepan on low heat and continue to whisk gently until the mixture is thickened to about the consistency of a loose pudding.</li>\n<li>Remove the citrus peels and cover with cling wrap. Let the custard cool completely.</li>\n<li>Preheat your oven to 400° F. Give a large muffin tray a very light coating of butter.</li>\n<li>Remove your dough from the fridge and unwrap it. Using a sharp knife begin cutting the roll into 1/4-inch slices.</li>\n<li>Using your thumbs and some water for lubrication, kneed the dough slices to make a cup shape and place in the muffin tin.</li>\n<li>Once you have the muffin tray full of cups, remove the plastic wrap from the chilled custard and give it a gentle stir. Fill each pastry “cup” with the custard so that there is about a 1/2-inch of space left at the top.</li>\n<li>Place in the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and the custard is set.</li>\n<li>Cool on a rack and dust with cinnamon and confectioners sugar.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 14, 2021","slug":"/recipes/pastel-de-nata","title":"Pastel de nata","imageUrl":"https://recipes-md.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pastel-de-nata.jpeg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/recipes/pastel-de-nata"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
