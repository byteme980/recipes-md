Pat the chicken dry and season with salt and pepper, then add to the mixture, coating it well.</p>\n<p>Heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high until very hot, ~2 minutes. Add the onions in an even layer. Season with salt, then cook, mostly undisturbed, for 4 minutes more, stirring every minute or so.</p>\n<p>Add the mushrooms, season with salt, and stir to combine. Allow to cook mostly undisturbed until the mushrooms shrink and start to brown, about 4 minutes, stirring every minute or so.</p>\n<p>Stir in  3 tablespoons of olive oil and allow the onions to cook until they start to color, stirring and lowering the heat as necessary to avoid burning, about 2 minutes.</p>\n<p>Push the onions and mushrooms to the edges of the skillet, then add the chicken pieces to the center. Cook undisturbed for 4 to 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>Combine the chicken and vegetables and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes more.</p>\n<p>Put the pasta in to cook now.</p>\n<p>Add 2 teaspoons of sherry vinegar and a handful of spinach so it begins to wilt. Stir and scrape up anything on the bottom of the skillet. Season to taste with salt.</p>\n<p>Remove the skillet from heat and top with the parsley and cheese. Serve with bread or pasta.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 12, 2021","slug":"/recipes/chicken-with-mushrooms-and-caramelized-onions","title":"Chicken with mushrooms and caramelized onions","imageUrl":"https://recipes-md.s3.amazonaws.com/images/chicken-with-mushrooms-and-caramelized-onions.jpeg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/recipes/chicken-with-mushrooms-and-caramelized-onions"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
